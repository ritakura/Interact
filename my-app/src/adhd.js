        According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/facts.html">CDC</a>, "ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood. It is usually first diagnosed in childhood and often lasts into adulthood. Children with ADHD may have trouble paying attention, controlling impulsive behaviors (may act without thinking about what the result will be), or be overly active."
